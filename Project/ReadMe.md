This project made for my last assignment. Using JavaFX & third party libraries<br>
You'll come across beautiful UI made in SceneBuilder & great functionalities provides<br>
searhing, sorting, adding, removing, saving, loading & much more.<br>
This project was my last project & really hope that I won't touch java ever ever but ever again<br>
